  mean_x = sum(x)/length(x)
  mean_y = sum(y)/length(y)
  numerator = sum( (x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y) )
  denominator = sum( (x - mean_x)**2 )

  b1 = numerator / denominator
  b0 = mean_y - (b1*mean_x)

n = 1000
x = rnorm(n)
e = rnorm(n)
y = 0.5 + (1.8*x) + e

#5
get_b0_b1(x , y)

#6
#The estimates for b0 and b1 are not equal ot the true values of 0.5 and 1.8 because of noise (e).  

#7
e = rnorm(n)
y = 0.5 + (1.8*x) + e

get_b0_b1(x , y)

#The new estimates are not the same as the initial estimationbecause we obtain new noise values when recalulating e.
